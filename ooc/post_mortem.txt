Basically this was my first serious attempt at competitive programming. The resulted code is quite messy, have a quite a few repetitive fragments and even after some refactoring remained in an experimental state it was during the contest. But I still hope that the structure of the code is mostly clear and the code is somewhat readable.

This version is not runnable for obvious reasons, but still can be used as some kind of a starter code.
